                <h3>Lawrence of Arabia</h3>
                <p class="movie-desc">The film depicts Lawrence's experiences in the Arabian Peninsula during World War I, in particular his attacks on Aqaba and Damascus and his involvement in the Arab National Council. Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the personal violence inherent in war, his own identity, and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army and his new-found comrades within the Arabian desert tribes. </p>

                <h3>Le Mépris</h3>
                <p class="movie-desc">American film producer Jeremy Prokosch (Jack Palance) hires respected Austrian director Fritz Lang (playing himself) to direct a film adaptation of Homer's Odyssey. Dissatisfied with Lang's treatment of the material as an art film, Prokosch hires Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli), a novelist and playwright, to rework the script. The conflict between artistic expression and commercial opportunity parallels Paul's sudden estrangement from his wife Camille Javal (Brigitte Bardot), who becomes aloof with Paul after he leaves her alone with Prokosch, a millionaire playboy.</p>

                <h3>Le Guépard</h3>
                <p class="movie-desc">In the 1860s, a dying aristocracy struggles to maintain itself against a harsh Sicilian landscape. The film traces the waning of the noble home of the Prince of Salina (the Leopard) and the corresponding rise to eminence of the enormously wealthy, ex-peasant, Don Calogero Sedara. The prince refuses to take active steps to halt the decline of his personal fortunes or to help build a new Sicily but his nephew Tancredi, Prince of Falconeri, assures his own position by marrying Don Calogero's beautiful daughter Angelica.</p>
